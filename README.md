# Etch-A-Sketch

A simple program in which each grid cell is colored on hover. Upon clearing the grid, a simple modal appears prompting the user to create a new grid. A combination of JavaScript and native HTML features are used to validate user input.

In addition to the necessary skills required to program, I learned:
* Use **viewport height and width** to create a consistent layout amongst differently-sized screens
* Use **media query** to adjust layout on **portrait** screens
* Create a **modal** and manipulate it using JavaScript
* Use multiple **event listeners**
* Utilize **default parameters** in a function
* Understand and create **nested loops**
* Use the Constraint Validation API to **validate** an input
* Use **parseInt()** to convert string to a number type
